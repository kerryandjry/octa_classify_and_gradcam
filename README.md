# A Study on Recognizing Diabetic Retinopathy Images using Deep Learning
The goal of this project is to detect such retinal diseases through Angio optical coherence tomography
images by using deep learning. The goal of this project is to collect Angio optical coherence tomography
images, label them, train a model for classifying diabetic retinopathy by using deep learning model.
